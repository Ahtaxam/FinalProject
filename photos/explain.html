                    Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the greatest blessings for human life; 
                    however, nowadays humans fail to recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets,
                    writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems and
                    stories in the glory of it. They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today.
                    Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe,
                    the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich 
                    and vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things. Therefore, people of the modern age 
                    should also learn something from people of yesteryear.and start valuing nature before it gets too late.

                        Nature has been in existence long before humans and ever since it has taken care of 
                        mankind and nourished it forever. In other words, it offers us a protective layer 
                        which guards us against all kinds of damages and harms. 
                        Survival of mankind without nature is impossible and humans need to understand that.
                        If nature has the ability to protect us, it is also powerful enough to destroy the entire mankind. 
                        Every form of nature, for instance, the plants, animals, rivers, mountains, moon, and more holds equal 
                        significance for us. Absence of one element is enough to cause a catastrophe in the functioning of
                         human life.

                    We fulfill our healthy lifestyle by eating and drinking healthy, which nature gives us. 
                    Similarly, it provides us with water and food that enables us to do so. Rainfall and sunshine,
                     the two most important elements to survive are derived from nature itself.
        
                    Further, the air we breathe and the wood we use for various purposes are a gift of nature only. But, 
                    with technological advancements, people are not paying attention to nature. The need to conserve and 
                    balance the natural assets is rising day by day which requires immediate attention.

                        Nature is the most beautiful and attractive surrounding around us which make us happy and 
                        provide us natural environment to live healthy. Our nature provides us variety of beautiful
                         flowers, attractive birds, animals, green plants, blue sky, land, running rivers, sea,
                          forests, air, mountains, valleys, hills and many more things. Our God has created a 
                          beautiful nature for the healthy living of us. All the things we use for our living are 
                          the assets of nature which we should not spoil and damage.
                        We should not destroy the originality of the nature and should not imbalance the ecosystem 
                        cycle. Our nature provides us beautiful environment to live and enjoy so it is our 
                        responsibility to keep it clean and away from all the damages. In the modern era, many 
                        selfish and bad activities of the human being have disturbed the nature to a great extent.
                         But we all should try to maintain our natureâ€™s beauty.
